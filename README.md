# Simple-Neural-Network

This Python script shows the process of normalizing data using Min-Max scaling with scikit-learn's MinMaxScaler. The normalized data is then used to train a simple neural network for predicting house prices based on house sizes. The trained model is evaluated on a test set, and the results are visualized using matplotlib. The code is the  example of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a regression task using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
